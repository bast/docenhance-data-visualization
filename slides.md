## About me

## Goals for this course

<!-- set expectations for this course -->

### Our focus

- Data visualization for .emph[academic publications and presentations]
- Practical recommendations
- .emph[Reproducibility]


### What I will not focus on

- Programming languages and tools
  > .remark[But I will point to examples to get you on a good track]
- Data visualization for the general public
  > .remark[Very important but they often have different requirements]

---

## Resources

- Point to existing resources

## Quote from Wilke's book

## 2 take-home messages

### Avoid tools that cannot be automated/scripted

- It may cause you the last minute trouble.
- Stay away from tools where plots can only be modified manually by pointing
  and clicking.


### Optimize for comprehension and accessibility

- So that I don't have to study the plot for 20 minutes with eyes hurting to
  get the message.
- Font size, colors, suitable representation, good title and caption.

# Why visualizing data?

<!-- 5 min -->

---

- More insight into data
- Seeing patterns and seeing problems
- Anscombe's quartett
- Because others do it (and we often copy the style and culture)
- Presentations
- Communication with the public

# Taxonomy of visualizations

<!-- 10 min -->

---

## Where to find good overviews

Taxonomy, examples, and main pitfall for each:
- Amounts
- Distributions
- Proportions
- x-y relationships
- Time series
- Trends
- Geospatial data
- Uncertainty

# Choosing the right tools

<!-- 10 min -->

---

- Many tools exist and there is not the one right choice
- Why free software
- Why scriptable software (batch processing and reproducibility; more about that in next section)
- Reproducibility and FAIR
- Why automating and working in plain text

# Reproducible and reusable plots

<!-- 10 min -->

---

- Many tools exist and there is not the one right choice
- Why free software
- Why scriptable software (batch processing and reproducibility; more about that in next section)
- Reproducibility and FAIR
