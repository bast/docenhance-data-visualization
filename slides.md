## Goals for this course

<!-- set expectations for this course -->

### Our focus

- Data visualization for .emph[academic publications and presentations]
- .emph[Practical] recommendations
- .emph[Reproducibility]
- Know which tools exist


### What I will not focus on

- Programming languages and tools
  > .remark[But I will point to examples to get you on a good track]
- Data visualization for the general public
  > .remark[Very important but they often have different requirements]

---

## Resources

### Books

- ["Fundamentals of Data Visualization", C. O. Wilke](https://clauswilke.com/dataviz/)
  > .remark[Excellent book which does not focus on R or Python but on the fundamentals]
- ["Data Visualization: A practical introduction", K. Healy](https://socviz.co/)
  > .remark[Good if you want to learn R at the same time]
- ["Data Visualisation: A Handbook for Data Driven Design", A. Kirk](https://www.visualisingdata.com/book/)
  > .remark[Great book but a bit too general for me]

> .remark[There are many more ...]

.quote["One thing I have learned over the years is that automation is your
friend. I think figures should be autogenerated as part of the data analysis
pipeline (which should also be automated), and they should come out of the
pipeline ready to be sent to the printer, no manual post-processing needed."]

## 2 take-home messages

### Avoid tools that cannot be automated/scripted

- It may cause you the last minute trouble.
- Stay away from tools where plots can only be modified manually by pointing
  and clicking.


### Optimize for comprehension and accessibility

- So that we don't have to study the plot for 20 minutes with eyes hurting to
  get the message.
- Font size, colors, suitable representation, good title and caption.

All four plots have the .emph[same] mean of x and y, sample variance of *x* and
*y*, correlation between *x* and *y*, linear regression line, and *R^2* coefficient.

## Why visualizing data?


### More insight into data: easier to see patterns and problems

.quote["... make both calculations and graphs. Both sorts of output should be
studied; each will contribute to understanding."]
.cite[F. J. Anscombe, 1973]


### Communicating insight

- Presentations
- Communication with the public

### Because others do it or tell us to

- And we often copy the style and culture

# Choosing the right tools

<!-- 10 min -->

---

- Many tools exist and there is not the one right choice
- Why free software
- Why scriptable software (batch processing and reproducibility; more about that in next section)
- Reproducibility and FAIR
- Why automating and working in plain text
