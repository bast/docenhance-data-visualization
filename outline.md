# Data visualization

#### Take home messages

- avoid tools that you do not have a good control over (cannot be automated/scripted), it may cause you the last minute trouble (if no scripting or batch processing possible)
- optimize for comprehension/accessibility (so that i don't have to
  study it for 20 minutes with eyes hurting to get the message)


#### (5 min) Intro and literature overview

- Point to existing resources
- Set expectations for this course


#### (5 min) Why visualizing data

- More insight into data
- Seeing patterns and seeing problems
- Anscombe's quartett
- Because others do it (and we often copy the style and culture)
- Presentations
- Communication with the public


#### (10 min) Figure design, design process and fundamentals

- Design approach
- Coordinates
- Proportional ink
- Channels
- Colors
- Sketch, try, refine later
- Other pitfalls


#### (10 min) Taxonomy of visualizations

Taxonomy, examples, and main pitfall for each:
- Amounts
- Distributions
- Proportions
- x-y relationships
- Time series
- Trends
- Geospatial data
- Uncertainty


#### (10 min) Choosing the right tool

- Many tools exist and there is not the one right choice
- Why free software
- Why scriptable software (batch processing and reproducibility; more about that in next section)
- Demo with links to working recipes:
  - R/ggplot2 on R Studio/R Markdown
  - Python/matplotlib on Jupyter
  - Interactive plots: R shiny, JavaScript/D3.js


#### (10 min) Reproducible and reusable plots

- Reproducibility and FAIR
- Why automating and working in plain text
- Where/how to store input data, scripts, and results
- Documenting the tools and environment used
- Demo with links to working recipes:
  - Binder
  - Zenodo


#### (10 min) Data formats

- Standard data formats
- Tidy data
- Data cleaning
- Folder organization
- Where to store it
- Data privacy for sensitive data


#### (5 min) Figures and tables in reports and publications

- Titles
- Captions
- Cross-referencing
